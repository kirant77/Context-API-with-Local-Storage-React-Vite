 # 📝 React Todo App with Context API & Tailwind CSS

A beautiful, responsive Todo List application built using **React**, **Vite**, **Tailwind CSS**, and **Context API**. Todos are saved in **Local Storage**, so your tasks persist across page reloads.

# 📄 Description

This is a simple yet powerful Todo List application built using React and styled with Tailwind CSS. The application is designed for fast, intuitive task management and features a clean, modern user interface.

One of the standout features of this app is its use of the React Context API for global state management. Instead of using external libraries like Redux, the Context API allows state (such as the list of todos and associated operations) to be easily shared across deeply nested components without prop drilling. All state logic—such as adding, editing, deleting, and toggling todo completion—is managed globally and efficiently using this approach.

To enhance the user experience, Local Storage is integrated for persistent data storage. This means that your tasks are automatically saved in the browser, and remain available even after you refresh the page or close and reopen the browser. This seamless combination of Context API + Local Storage ensures both scalability and data reliability in a lightweight, dependency-free way.
